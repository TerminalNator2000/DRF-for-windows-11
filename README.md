# DRF-for-Windows-11

Welcome to **DRF-for-Windows-11**, a Django REST Framework tutorial tailored specifically for developers using Windows 10 or 11. If you've ever felt left out in the sea of Unix-based tutorials, this one's for you. üñ•Ô∏è

## Why This Tutorial Exists
If you've searched for Django REST Framework (DRF) tutorials, you've probably noticed a trend:
- "Open your terminal and run `./manage.py`..."
- "Use `bash` or `zsh` to set up your environment..."
- "Install tools that are only available on Linux or macOS..."

Well, what about Windows users? üò§

This project is here to bridge that gap. It's a complete guide to setting up and running a DRF project on **Windows 10 and 11**. No need to feel like an outsider anymore‚Äîwe've got you covered.

## What's Included
- Step-by-step setup instructions using **PowerShell**.
- Windows-specific configurations (because `env\Scripts\activate` is a thing).
- A fully functional DRF app to get you started.

## Features
- **API Root and User List**: Quickly get up and running with DRF's browsable API.
- **Windows-Friendly Commands**: All commands and configurations tested and verified for Windows.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Even if you're new to Django or REST APIs, you'll feel right at home.

## Who Is This For?
- **Windows Users**: Specifically those running Windows 10 or 11.
- **Django Beginners**: If you're starting your DRF journey, this is a great place to begin.
